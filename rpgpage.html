                        <p class="mb-5">Everybody likes story games, right? but imagine an RPG one, Nah not like that, we are talking about real RPG stuff, not just customizations. We are talking about leading the story, writing your own destiny, failure or glory, that’s on you. And you only. Let’s take a look at one of the adventures you might run into while exploring the open world.
                         </p>
                        <hr class="mb-5">
                        <p class="mb-5">Imagine you are riding your horse across the long forest, you just realize there are a couple of riders coming to your road. <br>
                        Wait, there is also a girl, a loyal one. Daughter of one of the local lords with her guards. But she seems unhappy with those guards. And let’s be honest guards are looking really annoying. <br> <br>
                        Now, there are a couple of actions to take here.   <br><br>
                        First You can hit the knights, let’s say your choice to do that, <br><br>
                        What if you lost the fight? <br><br>
                         They are not just gonna kill you, they are gonna take you as a captive, after beating you up, they are gonna tie your arms and legs and arms.<br><br>
                         After a while you wake up, actually, somebody woke you up, gets you to the main room, then you see the girl, she still seems unhappy. Next to the girl, you see her father, which is currently laughing.His soldiers throwing some sticky things at to you and make fun of you.<br><br>
                         <b>So we start with Station A, then our choice got us to A.1.Lose, but it's not over yet,</b> <br><br>
                         Depending on your RPG tree and your character skill development so far, there will be different scenarios.<br><br>
                        Let’s say your character has a good body shape and his strong level is high, then the local lord will offer you a fight with his nephew, the offer is fought for life, if you win the fight they are will let you go but they will take some of your items. If you lose, poor you, they will hang you.
                        <br><br>
                        You know you are really strong, then why did he want his nephew to challenge you, I mean, isn’t that dangerous for their house? Then you realize there is a young man sitting next to the girl you saw earlier, with a crown much smaller than his father’s. you assume that it’s the local lord’s son. Then you think there might be a problem between the local lord and his brother. That’s just might be the reason he wants you to fight his nephew. <br><br>
                        This is not a fair fight though, I mean, you are strong and everything but you haven’t eaten anything for hours and really tired. But still, there might be a chance for you. <br><br>
                        Let’s say you lost the fight, people will make fun of you, then the nephew will cut your head off with his sword, the last thing you saw was the local lord’s unhappy face. <br><br>
                        Let’s say you won the fight,<br><br>

                        After winning the fight, people will cheer you, local lords will congratulate you and tell his men to feed you, feed you well. Oh, that must feel nice, eating some good food after hours. After drinking boozes you doze off. Later on, somebody wakes you up. Tells you to go with him.<br><br>
                        If You say no. <br><br>
                        You wake up in the morning and continue your journey, that’s one of the endings.<br><br>
                        But if you say yes,<br><br>
                        The guy will take you to the barn, tells you to ride with him, you will ride a bit until you see an old shack. When you get inside you see the local lord. He starts talking about his problem with his brother, says “I saw your strength traveler, I think you can serve me even more, not for free of course, a lord like me always pays well” He offers you a job to kill your brother and gives you the information and instructions to do the job. You can the job if you want to later on.<br>    <br>
                        When you leave the shack you see his daughter, the girl you see at the beginning. She also wants you to help her father, and once you did the job she asks you to speak with her as well. After done talking with her, you take the horse and continue your journey.
                        <br><br>
                        Now, let's head back. What if you won the first fight which was against the knights? 
                        <br><br>
                        After winning the fight the girls ask to speak with you, she says you can take the prize for this glory fight, and asks you to come and talk with his father, she says that her father can pay you well. If you say no you just take to coin and the items on the guards and continue your journey. If you say yes, she takes you to a shack, and her father waits for you in there. You know the rest of the story. 
                        <br><br>
                        Let's head back to where it all begins, what if you don’t want to interact with the knights or the girl.
                        <br><br>
                        Well, then you don’t, you can just continue your journey and enjoy the ride in the long forest.<br>
                        And that’s not even a part of the main mission, that’s just a sub-story!<br>
                        There are more adventures like that in this open-world, waits for you to explore!<br>
